# APPOINTY_API
Technical task done for APPOINTY summer internship. A meeting scheduling API made on GO language.


I've done as much as I could. 
To schedule a meeting (that is to add a meeting), you can type localhost:10000/schedule in your browser.
To display the meetings, you can type localhost:10000/meetings in your browser.
To display a particular meeting using an ID, you can type localhost:10000/meeting/return in your browser.

This was completely new for me as i don't have any experiance with GO language but I tried my best.
